        <h1>Top 5 Website Makers in India (2025 Edition) – Honest Comparison of Price, Features & Trust</h1>
        <p>If you’ve already tried searching “best website maker in India,” “cheap website design,” or “how much does a website cost,” you’ve probably noticed one thing:</p>
        <p><strong>👉 The internet is confusing.</strong></p>
        <p>Some platforms tell you it’s free (but secretly charge monthly)…<br />Some agencies quote ₹25,000 to ₹50,000 for a “basic website”…<br />And if you find someone offering a website under ₹1,000 — you immediately feel it’s a scam.</p>
        <p>So today, let’s clear the noise.</p>
        <p>I’ve compared the Top 5 ways to get a website in India, based on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>✅ Pricing (Real cost, not advertised price)</li>
          <li>✅ Ease of use / maintenance</li>
          <li>✅ Professional quality</li>
          <li>✅ Long-term reliability</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By the end, you’ll know exactly what to choose — based on your budget, time, and skill level.</p>
        <h2>1. Wix – Great for Beginners, But Can Get Expensive Long Term</h2>
        <p>Wix is famous for its drag-and-drop builder. No coding, lots of templates — perfect for DIY creators.</p>
        <strong>Pros:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Easy to use even for non-tech users</li>
          <li>Lots of templates and design flexibility</li>
          <li>Built-in hosting</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Cons:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Pricing starts at ₹1500+/month for a proper custom domain</li>
          <li>Once you choose a template → you can’t change it later</li>
          <li>Long-term cost becomes higher than actually hiring someone</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want to experiment and build on their own — and are okay paying ₹15,000+ per year.</p>
        <h2>2. WordPress + Freelance Developer – Flexible, But Requires Effort & Maintenance</h2>
        <p>WordPress is like Lego — very customizable, but you must assemble it.</p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Item</th><th>Cost</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Domain</td><td>₹600–800/year</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Hosting</td><td>₹2000–4000/year</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Theme / Plugins</td><td>₹1000–3000 (optional)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Freelancer / Developer</td><td>₹5,000–₹20,000 (one-time)</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <strong>Pros:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>✔ Maximum flexibility</li>
          <li>✔ Good for blogs, business, portfolio</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Cons:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>❌ Needs regular updates</li>
          <li>❌ If something breaks, you’re stuck calling developers again</li>
          <li>❌ Security & maintenance is your responsibility</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Someone willing to manage their own website.</p>
        <h2>3. Shopify – Best for E-commerce, But Not for Service-Based Businesses</h2>
        <p>If you want to sell products online → Shopify is excellent.<br />But if you’re not selling physical products → it’s overkill.</p>
        <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Starting ₹2,000 – ₹4,000/month + Transaction fees</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Proper online stores (not consultants, clinics, or service providers).</p>
        <h2>4. Local Freelancers / Small Agencies – Hit or Miss</h2>
        <p>You’ll find tons of people on Instagram / WhatsApp offering websites for ₹1,500 to ₹10,000.</p>
        <p>Some are really good designers. Others will take advance and disappear.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>✅ If you get the right one, result can be excellent.</li>
          <li>❌ If you get the wrong one, you’ll spend more in repairs later.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>5. Microsite (India) – Professional Website at Just ₹499 with AI-Powered Design</h2>
        <p>Let’s talk about the fastest-growing website solution in India right now.</p>
        <p>Microsite is a startup built by a team of designers & AI engineers, focused on making professional websites affordable for everyone.</p>
        <p>At first glance, people think:<br />“How can they make a proper website at ₹499? Must be low quality.”</p>
        <p>That’s a fair doubt — because traditionally, websites were manually coded by developers charging ₹10,000 to ₹50,000.</p>
        <p>But here’s the truth:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>✅ Microsite uses AI & automated design workflows, which reduces manpower time.</li>
          <li>✅ Templates are professionally pre-designed, then customized quickly.</li>
          <li>✅ Hosting, SSL, and setup are streamlined at scale.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In simple words: They’re not cheap — they’re efficient.</p>
